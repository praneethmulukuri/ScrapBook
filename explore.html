		<h1>ABOUT SCRAPBOOK</h1><br><br>
		<p>A number of years ago,scrapbooks were usually little more than clipping from newspapers,
			snippets of hair and baby announcements. There were <q>wedding albums</q> and <q>baby books</q>
			and some family treasures stowed in albums somewhere. To some that will always be the 
			definition of a scrapbook. A scrapbook,you see, means different things to different people. And they are all right.
			But it also means no size fits all.</p>
		<p>Some scrapbook albums have lots of journaling, some have none, some have a simplified style, others are very complex.
		 	There are scrapbookers who preach double page layouts, others, single page layouts. Some trumpet 12x12 pages, and for 
			others 8 1/2 x 11 pages rule the day. And still, others do alternate sizes. Stickers and die cuts may be the main
			 attractions or tear art and decorative paper may take center stage. Some scrapbookers keep their layouts in neat,
			 catalogued binders, while others showcase their work on living room walls.</p>
		<p>There is, however, one thing that all good scrapbook pages do: they tell a story. And for us, that is the heart of scrapbooking.
			 A scrapbook is a story and scrapbooking is storytelling at a precious, personal level. It is organizing moments of the past
			 so they have meaning for future generations. It is a recognition that events make up lives, and it is a celebration of living.
			 Embodied in every scrapbook page is a celebration of life, a moment or moments captured that are especially unique to a person
			 or family. Scrapbookers today are preserving yesterday for tomorrow.</p>
		<p>The whole scrapbooking phenomenon is remarkably social. Chatty or thoughtful, the scrapbookers are looking for ways and tools to
			 tell their stories better. They actively help, teach and suggest to each other unique ideas and new methods, tips and tricks
			 for improving scrapbooks and the experience. Whether the layouts spring to life in quiet basements or erupt at raucous crafting
			 parties, they are a product of this community.</p>
		<p>So, though scrapbooks are all about storytelling, they are also about being a part of a community that<br>
			<ul><li>senses intuitively the importance of history and its preservation</li>
				<li>knows the importance of identity and its role in people's lives</li>
				<li>clings to the importance of preservation as a part of nurturing</li>
				<li>sees the wisdom of order</li>
				<li>and finally, but not necessarily last, insists on the essential ingredient of fun.</li></ul>
		<p>We believe that it's no accident that most scrapbookers are women. Sensitive to relationships, women connect readily with the past
			 and the present - hence the desire to preserve the past for the future, to weave webs of memories through time to hearts 5,
			 10, or 20 years from now. Memories, they intuitively understand, shape our family's and our individual perceptions of the present
			. A scrapbook is what you want or need it to be.</p>
